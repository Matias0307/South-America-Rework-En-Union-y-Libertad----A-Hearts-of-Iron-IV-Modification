This all led to the split up of the party in 1920, with Frugoni and his followers being kicked out of the new Partido Comunista. \n\nBut despite all of this, both parties share a similar goal in mind, and with the recent political crisis in Uruguay following the bloody overthrowing of Gabriel Terra, Frugoni may be able to make concessions to the communists in order to creating a coalition to stabilize his rocky position as president."

 BRA_patrianovism_on_the_rise_desc:0 "Ever since the absolution of the Empire back in 1889, there have been many unsuccesful attempts to restore the monarchy, such as the Canudos War, or the Revolt of Ribeirãozinho. However, all of these attempts failed and were quickly crushed, and yet there are many Brazilians who still yearn for the return of the monarchy and the restoration of the Empire. The Patrianovistas, led by Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, offer a new approach to the Empire, one with a more authoritarian approach, and a firm believer of equal rights between black and white Brazilians. The Patrianovistas offer a newfound hope to restore the monarchy for those still fond of the imperial days, and with combined effort, we can push through and make it a reality. \n\nIt will be tough, and there will be many obstacles ahead of us, but we'll push ahead, no matter what path we take!"

The Liberals responded fire with fire, and what resulted was a bloody civil war, claiming the lives of more than 2000 Ecuadorians.
