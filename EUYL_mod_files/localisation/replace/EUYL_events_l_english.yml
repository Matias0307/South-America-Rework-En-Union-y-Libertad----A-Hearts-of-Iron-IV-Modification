 germany.4.t:0 "Anschluss"
 germany.4.d:0 "Repeated uprisings in Austria clearly show that the people there long to be united with our Reich. It is now time to take action and allow the will of the people to be made manifest."
 germany.4.a:0 "How can anyone say that Austria is not German?!"
 germany.5.t:0 "Anti-Comintern Pact"
 germany.5.d:1 "Germany proposes that we sign a pact to address the Comintern's goal of spreading Communism worldwide, through the use of subversion and violence. By signing this pact, we agree to share intelligence on the Communist threat and act in close cooperation against this menace."
 germany.5.a:0 "Join"
 germany.5.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.6.t:0 "The Tripartite Pact"
 germany.6.d:0 "The signees consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."
 germany.6.a:0 "Join"
 germany.6.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.11.t:0 "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d:0 "The German Foreign Ministry has proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."
 germany.11.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 germany.11.a.tt:0 "§RWhile the pact is in effect, the Closed Economy trade policy will be unavailable.\nThe War With Germany focus will be unavailable for two years.§!\n"
 germany.11.b:0 "No deals with the fascists!"
 germany.12.t:0 "Moscow Signs the Pact"
 germany.12.d:0 "The Soviet Union has wisely agreed to sign our non-aggression pact. This means that we are free to act without risk of Soviet intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of the Bolsheviks getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d:0 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the Soviet sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the Soviets occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."
 germany.14.a:0 "Yes. Treaty stipulations must be obeyed."
 germany.14.b:0 "No! All of Poland belongs to the Vaterland!"
 germany.15.t:0 "Germany Honors the Pact"
 germany.15.d:0 "In accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, German forces have evacuated eastern Poland and our own troops have moved in to occupy the territory."
 germany.16.t:0 "Germany Betrays the Pact"
 germany.16.d:0 "Germany has refused to partition Poland with us, in a blatant violation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact! This betrayal has rendered our treaty with them null and void!"
 germany.16.a:0 "We were fools to trust the fascists!"
 germany.20.t:0 "Second Vienna Award"
 germany.20.d:0 "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from Hungary and incorporated into Romania in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles. Should Northern Transylvania be returned to Hungarian control?"
 germany.20.a:0 "Give Hungary Northern Transylvania."
 germany.20.b:0 "Give Hungary all of Transylvania."
 germany.20.c:0 "Transylvania shall remain in Romania."
 germany.21.t:0 "Romania Rejects Our Verdict"
 germany.21.d:0 "Romania has refused to abide by the decision we reached in the Second Vienna Award! Their delegation has been recalled to Bucharest, and no territory has been surrendered to Hungary."
 germany.21.a:0 "The will of Germany must be obeyed!"
 germany.22.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Folds"
 germany.22.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has agreed to our demands, and Memel will be incorporated back into East Prussia. Yet another unlawfully stolen province has been returned to the German nation!"
 germany.22.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.23.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that Germany has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."
 germany.23.a:0 "Stubborn fools."
 germany.24.t:0 "German Military Mission to China"
 germany.24.d:0 "Germany has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A German military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army.\n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the Japanese, given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese."
 germany.24.a:0 "Recall von Falkenhausen."
 germany.24.b:0 "No, our advisors will stay."
 germany.24.c:0 "No, our advisors will stay, just as we have promised the Chinese."
 germany.25.t:0 "Military Advisors Recalled"
 germany.25.d:0 "Deteriorating relations with China has made it politically unfeasible to maintain a military mission in their country. Alexander von Falkenhausen and the rest of our advisors have been recalled."
 germany.25.a:0 "We shall put him to work."
 germany.26.t:0 "China Detains Military Advisors"
 germany.26.d:0 "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisors that were reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."
 germany.26.a:0 "Good man!"
 germany.27.t:0 "Fortifying the Westwall"
 germany.27.d:0 "Army pioneers have finished their survey of our existing fortifications, and identified the locations where they should be strengthened. The necessary construction orders have been placed."
 germany.27.a:0 "This will hold better than the Siegfried Line."
 germany.28.t:0 "Germans press for Anschluss"
 germany.28.d:0 "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany in a union of German peoples. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss, which would see Austria annexed into their nation."
 germany.28.a:0 "We shall join the German Reich!"
 germany.28.b:0 "No, Austria's destiny lies elsewhere."
 germany.29.t:0 "Austria refuses the Anschluss!"
 germany.29.d:0 "The fools in Vienna have refused to accept the merger of our two nations! This is a blatant disregard for the will of the Austrian people, and it will not stand! We may have to enforce the Anschluss through military means."
 germany.29.a:0 "We must prepare for a military intervention."
 germany.40.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 germany.40.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the British position be?"
 germany.40.d_2:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. As we have already proven that we won't accept German expansionism, this means we now have another ally in the war against Germany."
 germany.40.d_3:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between the Netherlands, Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the Dutch position be?"
 germany.40.a:0 "The Czechs are on their own."
 germany.40.b:0 "Czechoslovakia must be defended!"
 germany.41.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have made it clear that they have no intention of going to war over a 'quarrel in a far-away country.' Should we follow their lead, or will we honor our obligations to Czechoslovakia by offering them support?"
 germany.41.a:0 "Leave the Czechs to their fate."
 germany.41.b:0 "The British be damned! France supports her friends!"
 germany.42.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have refused to back down, and are instead threatening the Germans with war if they violate Czechoslovakia's borders. War may be imminent."
 germany.42.a:0 "We must prepare!"
 germany.42.b:0 "France should stay out of this."
 germany.43.t:0 "France leaves the Allies"
 germany.43.d:0 "The stubborn French have refused to follow our lead in the Sudeten Crisis! They stand by their support of Czechoslovakia, and since we do not they have decided to rescind our mutual alliance. Even now, France is preparing for an imminent war with Germany."
 germany.43.a:1 "Fools! [GER.GetLeader] must be appeased!"
 germany.44.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nFortunately, it looks like the Allies will stand by their earlier promises of support. They have threatened [GER.GetLeader] with war if our borders are violated in the slightest. Despite this, we must prepare for an imminent German attack."
 germany.44.a:0 "Good! Let them come!"
 germany.45.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nThe British cowards have refused to back our sovereignty, but at least the French are sticking up for us! They have abandoned their alliance with Britain and formed a new one with us, promising to support Czechoslovakia against German aggression."
 germany.45.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 germany.46.t:0 "The Munich Diktat"
 germany.46.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nBoth the British and French have rescinded their earlier promises to support us against German aggression. Their diplomats have made it clear that if we choose to resist the Germans, we do so on our own. Perhaps we have no choice but to surrender the Sudetenland..."
 germany.46.a:0 "This is a dark day for Europe."
 germany.46.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 germany.47.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British and their Allies have both rejected our rightful claims to the Sudetenland, and they have threatened us with war if we 'violate' the Czech border!\n\nA plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia has been drawn up, but this will likely trigger a general European war. We must make certain we are ready for this."
 germany.47.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their cooperation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead. It looks like we will have to deal with them both at the same time, but at least now the British hopefully won't intervene..."
 germany.48.a:0 "This may work to our advantage."
 germany.49.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nDespite the hopelessness of their situation, the stubborn Czechs are refusing to surrender their territory! We will have to take it by force. An invasion plan has been prepared that will wipe this vile experiment of Versailles off the face of the Earth!"
 germany.49.a:0 "The Czechs must be destroyed."
 germany.50.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nRecognizing the hopelessness of their situation, the Czechs have surrendered the Sudeten territories to us. Their oppressed German inhabitants will at long last be brought into the Vaterland!"
 germany.50.a:0 "This is a historic day for Germany."
 germany.51.t:0 "First Vienna Award"
 germany.51.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is a cancer tumor in the heart of Europe, and at last the Germans have decided to take decisive action against them. The Sudetenland has already been surrendered to Germany, and now, as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovakian territory that rightfully belongs to Hungary is to be returned to us."
 germany.51.a:0 "About time!"
 germany.52.t:0 "The Annexation of Zaolzie"
 germany.52.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is falling apart, and we must act quickly to protect territory with significant Polish populations before it can be seized by Germany. Czech ownership of Zaolzie has always been contested by us, and it is time for the region to join our nation."
 germany.52.a:0 "Zaolzie is ours!"
 germany.53.t:0 "The Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.53.d:0 "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defenses lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."
 germany.53.a:0 "Give in to the Germans."
 germany.53.b:0 "...yet still we must resist!"
 germany.54.t:0 "The Czechs Resist"
 germany.54.d:0 "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defenses were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.54.a:0 "Prague will soon be ours."
 germany.55.d:0 "The end of Czechoslovakia is at hand, and our forces are marching into Prague at this very moment. With the surrender of the Czechoslovakian military, we have liberated vast quantities of armaments. Their tanks, in particular, should serve our forces well.\n\nBöhmen will be annexed into Germany as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.d_2:0 "Having conquered Czechoslovakia, we must consider the best way to split up these territories.\n\nBöhmen remains German as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.a:0 "Set up Slovakia as a puppet state."
 germany.55.b:0 "Partition Czechoslovakia with Hungary."
 germany.55.c:0 "All of Czechoslovakia belongs to the Reich!"
 germany.56.t:0 "The Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.56.d:0 "German forces have entered Prague and the end of Czechoslovakia is imminent. They intend to annex Bohemia into the German Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.d_2:0 "After annexing Czechoslovakia, Germany is intending to retain Bohemia as part of the Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.a:0 "Of course! Greater Hungary will soon be a reality!"
 germany.56.b:0 "No, we do not need Slovakia or German friendship."
 germany.57.t:0 "Hungary Rejects Our Offer"
 germany.57.d:0 "The Hungarians have outrageously refused our generous offer to annex Slovakia, claiming they have no interest in the region! We will have to deal with them soon enough. For now, we must come up with a solution to the Slovakian Question."
 germany.57.a:0 "Set up Tiso's puppet government."
 germany.57.b:0 "Annex Slovakia into Germany."
 germany.58.t:0 "The Polish Question"
 germany.58.d:0 "The Reichsministerium of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has done an excellent job, and the people of Germany - indeed, the entire world - has been informed of the injustices our German brethren in Poland are forced to endure. We now have all the justification we need for a war!"
 germany.58.a:0 "Soon Poland will be no more!"
 germany.60.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland"
 germany.60.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region! Unless we issue an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal, the treaty will not be enforced."
 germany.60.a:0 "This is an act of war! Rally the British to our side!"
 germany.60.a.tt:0 "§RIf war breaks out, we will suffer a civil war due to our §YDisjointed Government:§!§!\n"
 germany.60.b:0 "Issue a diplomatic objection."
 germany.61.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French are mobilizing their forces, and seem intent on issuing an ultimatum. If Germany refuses, they are prepared to advance into Germany to deal with this threat. Popular opinion in Britain is against a war, but if we refuse to stand by the French our alliance with them will be dissolved."
 germany.61.a:0 "A war is out of the question."
 germany.61.b:0 "We must stand by France!"
 germany.62.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French seem content to limit their response to this breach to diplomatic objections, and public opinion in Britain is firmly against a war."
 germany.62.a:0 "We will issue an objection as well."
 germany.62.b:0 "Versailles concerns us no longer."
 germany.63.t:0 "Britain Refuses War"
 germany.63.d:0 "The British are refusing to support us against Germany, claiming that the Germans are 'simply walking in their own backyard.' If we go to war with them, it looks like we will be on our own.\n\nPublic opinion in France is against a war, but Germany will only grow stronger and the remilitarization of the Rhineland constitutes a direct threat against our borders. Issuing an ultimatum would be less threatening without Britain on our side. Should we proceed against them alone?"
 germany.63.a:0 "Yes! Germany must be dealt with now."
 germany.63.b:0 "No, without the British we must back down..."
 germany.64.t:0 "Britain Supports Us"
 germany.64.d:0 "Though popular support for a war is lacking in Britain, the British government has recognized the threat posed by the Germans and they have offered us their full support. We will issue a final ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. If they refuse, it is time for our forces to drive deep into Germany and put an end to their tyrannical regime!"
 germany.64.a:0 "Onwards!"
 germany.65.t:0 "France and Britain Mobilize!"
 germany.65.d:0 "The British and French have refused to accept the remilitarization of the Rhineland, calling it an 'unforgivable breach' of the Versailles Treaty. They are mobilizing their forces against us and have issued an ultimatum that our forces back down at once and the Rhineland remains demilitarized, or our nations are at war."
 germany.65.a:0 "We cannot back down! The Reich must be defended!"
 germany.65.b:0 "We are unprepared for this confrontation. We must back down."
 germany.66.t:0 "France Mobilizes!"
 germany.66.d:0 "The British have seen reason and accepted the remilitarization of the Rhineland, but the mad French are refusing to back down! Claiming that this incident constitutes a direct threat against the security of their nation, they are mobilizing their forces and may sweep in across the border at any moment! We are at war!"
 germany.67.t:0 "France Backs Down"
 germany.67.d:0 "The French wisely chose to back down when they realized that their mad enterprise wouldn't enjoy British support. Their forces have been demobilized and war has been averted for now. By golly, that was a close one!"
 germany.67.a:0 "A war now would be madness."
 germany.68.t:0 "France Refuses to Back Down"
 germany.68.d:0 "The French have stubbornly decided to go at it alone against the Germans, and our alliance with them has been rescinded. Yet another European war has broken out due to pointless squabbling. Perhaps it is time for Britain to distance itself from continental affairs again..."
 germany.68.a:0 "Perhaps it was inevitable."
 germany.70.t:0 "The Oster Conspiracy"
 germany.70.d:0 "Believing that Hitler has pushed Germany into a war it cannot win, a group of senior officers within the Wehrmacht have launched a coup! It appears to have been orchestrated by Colonel Hans Oster of the Abwehr, but generals Beck, von Brauchitsch, Halder and Admiral Canaris have also been confirmed as involved!\n\nHeavily-armed men lying in wait in several Berlin apartments have converged on the Reichskanzlei intent on liquidating Hitler and his closest associates. A fierce gun battle is currently raging inside the building."
 germany.70.a:0 "Protect the Führer at all costs!"
 germany.71.t:0 "The Führer is Dead"
 germany.71.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, but not before the dogs managed to kill Hitler! The Führer was found with several dozen gunshot wounds slumped over his desk - working tirelessly for the Vaterland to his last breath, no doubt!\n\nThe surviving conspirators will stand trial for their heinous crime, but for now Germany is at war and a new leader is needed. Who shall be the next Führer?"
 germany.71.a:0 "Herr Himmler will lead us into the future."
 germany.71.b:0 "Herr Göring is the logical choice."
 germany.72.t:0 "The Conspiracy Fails"
 germany.72.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, and Hitler himself led the clean-up effort with his trusty Luger. Miraculously, the Führer emerged from the fighting with only a few scratches.\n\nThe surviving conspirators will pay a steep price for their disloyalty, and Hitler is now even more committed towards prosecuting the current war towards a glorious victory!"
 germany.72.a:0 "Long live the Führer!"
 germany.73.t:0 "The Conspiracy Succeeds"
 germany.73.d:0 "The heavy fighting in the Reichskanzlei has reduced the building to a burning ruin. Despite a large number of SS soldiers rushing to Hitler's aid, army units loyal to the conspirators joined the fray and proved decisive. The Führer has been confirmed as killed, and the conspirators have successfully stormed all government buildings in Berlin.\n\nA large portion of the Wehrmacht has gone over to the other side, but many officers are still NSDAP loyalists. Who should be leading them?"
 germany.73.a:0 "Death to National Socialism!"
 germany.73.b:0 "Himmler will turn this around!"
 germany.73.c:0 "Göring is our only hope at this point!"
 germany.74.t:0 "Preparing the Ground"
 germany.74.d:0 "The Austrians are yearning to become part of the German Reich, but the stubborn government in Vienna has so far resisted all attempts to bring about a union. We must increase support for fascism in Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party will then become a viable alternative to the ruling austrofascists.\n\nAn Abwehr agent has been made available for an espionage mission. Use him to covertly increase popular support for fascism in Austria."
 germany.74.a:0 "Austria will be ours!"
 germany.75.t:0 "German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.75.d:0 "Despite harsh previous rhetoric against both the people and the ideological leadership of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetLeader] and Germany has now reached out to us, requesting a mutually beneficial research treaty. While exchanging knowledge would help our efforts to develop new tank designs along with promises of other research benefits in the future, there is little doubt considering previous statements that the Germans are doing this for their own sake. Should we go forward with the agreement despite the risk of aiding [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions?"
 germany.75.a:0 "The capitalists are a worse threat to us both."
 germany.75.b:0 "We won't give fascists the weapons to crush the proletariat!"
 germany.76.t:0 "Soviets Accept German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.76.d:0 "Our negotiations with the [From.GetName] have been successful. An agreement has been reached where our nations will aid each other in the development of new armored units, with a possible extension to other research areas in the future."
 germany.76.a:0 "This treaty will be a stepping stone to the future."
 germany.77.t:0 "Soviets Reject German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.77.d:0 "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armored unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.77.a:0 "They have hardly diminished the risks of it now."
 germany.78.t:0 "German Joint Air Research"
 germany.78.d:0 "As stipulated by the treaty with Germany, some of their special research projects share discoveries with our engineers. A recent breakthrough in radar technology has come to our attention, opening up unexpected opportunities to advance our research in the field."
 germany.78.a:0 "Detecting the enemy is the first step."
 germany.79.t:0 "Ultimatum from Germany"
 germany.79.d:0 "With Greece under the thumb of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has put pressure on our government to join their ranks. The Soviet-German alliance has put us in a position where neutrality is no longer an option, and now an ultimatum has arrived from Berlin demanding we cede our eastern territories to their Soviet allies and join them in the very pact they are using to force our hand.\n\nAlthough we cannot maintain neutrality, there are other options. Seeking support from Britain is one, standing our ground is another. None, however, can secure the future of the republic with certainty."
 germany.79.a:0 "If we work with the Germans, we may find the opportunity to reclaim other land."
 germany.79.b:0 "We can count on British support, and they can count on us."
 germany.79.c:0 "If these despots want to take our home, they have to fight for it."
 germany.80.t:0 "Danzig for Slovakia"
 germany.80.d:0 "The Germans have long had their eyes on Danzig, seeking to unite their territories in Ostpreussen with the rest of the German nation. Diplomats have warned that the day may come when they make us choose between Danzig or war.\n\nSurprisingly, we have been presented with what the Germans consider a more peaceful solution. They offer the newly created state of Slovakia, currently little more than a puppet state under German rule, to us in exchange for Danzig. \nWhat steps the Germans will take if we decline is unknown, but we have been given an opportunity to resolve this conflict with some territorial gains."
 germany.80.a:0 "This is the best offer we'll get."
 germany.80.b:0 "We will not give what is rightfully ours for what they have stolen!"
 germany.81.t:0 "Danzig Ceded for Slovakia"
 germany.81.d:0 "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbor."
 germany.81.a:0 "Germany is one again."
 germany.82.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to give up Danzig"
 germany.82.d:1 "Our generous offer of Slovakian territories to [From.GetNameDef] in exchange for Danzig has been rejected, leaving Danzig in Polish hands. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of Danzig as rightfully German territory. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming Danzig appear to have been exhausted."
 germany.82.a:0 "It may be time to consider other options."
 germany.83.t:0 "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 germany.83.d:0 "With the Anti-Comintern Pact, [From.GetNameDef] has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the Soviet menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-Soviet coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the Soviets, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
 germany.83.a:0 "We will stand by Germany and its allies against the Soviets."
 germany.83.b:0 "Anyone could start another world war with such a pact."

 china.6.d:0 "After the long retreat of the Communist Party of China's Red Army, they have managed to regroup and establish themselves in Shaanxi. Their continued effort to turn the rural population against us and seek support from the Soviet Union suggest that they might grow more powerful if left to their own devices. However, many of the surrounding warlords, despite supporting our government, are unwilling or unable to make the necessary sacrifices for an effective attack.\n\nIt's currently unclear whether the Red Army is still recuperating or ready to face us in battle, but time is not on our side. To strengthen our political position, we need to strike against the communists."

 china.7.d:0 "Although we have escaped certain defeat through the Long March, the nationalists are not planning to let us grow stronger without more confrontations. Our spies suggest they are mounting an offensive against us, which could weaken our political support if we try to retreat further.\n\nWe don't know how committed the Kuomintang are to pushing us back right now. Trying to confront them carries significant risks. If the local warlords have been rallied to support the attack, our chances may be slim. On the other hand, retreating now when we have finally stopped may not be an option."

 china.7.b:0 "Retreat into isolation."
 china.8.t:0 "Communists Retreat"
 china.8.d:0 "Discovering our planned offensive through their local spy network, the CPC have withdrawn their Red Army further into Shaanxi. Although this deprived us of the opportunity to further weaken their numbers, this has shown that the communists are not ready to confront us, despite what their propaganda says. To some extent, the effort has still worked to our benefit."
 china.8.a:0 "Cowards!"
 china.9.t:0 "Victory Against Communists"
 china.9.d:0 "Our commitment to routing the Red Army has been successful, at least for now. Despite gaining information about the attack, the communists decided to confront our forces and lost. They have now been forced to withdraw further and many of the locals have grown skeptical of their ability to deliver on their promises of overthrowing our government."
 china.9.a:0 "And rightly so!"
 china.10.t:0 "Communists Repel Attack"
 china.10.d:0 "Having gained information about our plans to launch an offensive beforehand, the Red Army was prepared and confronted our attack. The troops we had managed to assemble in this area, where our power base is weak, were insufficient to defeat the communist forces. \nSadly, the attack has been turned against us and seen as a sign of the Red Army's recovery after their long retreat."
 china.10.a:0 "It won't help them in the long run."
 china.11.t:0 "Defeat Against the Kuomintang"
 china.11.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to repel the attack of locally assembled troops supporting the nationalist government, our preparations were insufficient to stop it. With significant losses, we have been forced into a new retreat, albeit shorter.\n\nConfronting the nationalists before we had fully recovered may have been a mistake. Our magnificent recovery in the Long March instilled hope in our supporters, but now, seeds of doubt have been sown."
 china.11.a:0 "We will recover and win the faith of the people again."
 china.12.t:0 "Victory Against the Kuomintang"
 china.12.d:0 "Challenging the Kuomintang offensive has worked in our favor. The locally assembled troops sent to confront the Red Army were not prepared for our knowledge of the impending attack and were defeated, all serving as a warning to nearby warlords that attacking us can be costly. \n\nThe nationalists have only proven that they underestimate us as a foe, and that the People's Republic is once again on the rise."
 china.12.a:0 "Political Power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 china.13.t:0 "Clash with Communist Guerrillas"
 china.13.d:0 "With both us and the Chinese Red Army barely having recovered from our previous offensive, our mutual troop presence close to the border has reignited the conflict. In addition to the local warlords and militias, we have considered moving in more troops from elsewhere.\n\nAlthough this may not give us opportunity to crush the communist menace once and for all, it would be an important ideological victory to show that they will not be allowed to expand further."
 china.13.a:0 "We must draw the line now!"
 china.13.b:0 "We can't afford another confrontation."
 china.14.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 china.14.d:0 "Despite our efforts to push show that the communists will not be allowed to expand their influence outside of where they have currently taken refuge, we could not afford to commit enough resources to win the conflict along the [From.GetName] border.\n\nThe sporadic conflicts with communist militias slowly turned out more and more in their favor, which in the end made the campaign a failure in demonstrating that we have the situation under control. If their popular support keeps increasing, the communists could turn out to be a genuine threat."
 china.14.a:0 "Troubling."
 china.15.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 china.15.d:0 "After a number of smaller encounters in the outskirts of our controlled territory, the conflict with the Kuomintang appears to have turned to our advantage. Although maintaining constant pressure has been taxing on our troops and supplies, the effort has been worthwhile. \n\nNo decisive battles have been fought, we have won a slow victory this time, which has strengthened the faith in our cause and fanned the flames of the revolution once again."
 china.15.a:0 "This will not be soon forgotten!"
 china.16.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 china.16.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased Kuomintang presence has proven disastrous. The nationalists were simply more dedicated to pushing us back than we thought, perhaps expecting the impact this failure would have on our reputation. Although our army is once again safe to recover, for now, the losses have not gone unnoticed by the locals, and rumors of the failure of the revolution are already spreading to nearby villages."
 china.16.a:0 "The revolution is far from dead!"
 china.17.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 china.17.d:0 "Our efforts to draw the line against the threat of communism have been successful. The CPCs guerrilla campaigns in response to our increased troop presence in regions surrounding their power base failed to anticipate our dedication to stopping them. This show of strength, although not entirely without costs, has convinced many of the locals who previously gave their tacit support to [From.GetLeader] and his party have now begun to realize that China can never be united under such an ideology."
 china.17.a:0 "Let us hope they remember."
 china.18.t:0 "Clash with Nationalist Army"
 china.18.d:0 "While we have still barely recovered from their previous offensive, the nationalists appear to be increasing their troop presence in the areas close to our border.

 usa.6.d:0 "The day of the presidential election has arrived. Incumbent Franklin Delano Roosevelt has already implemented several of the programs referred collectively to as the New Deal, intended to take the US out of the Great Depression.\n\nWhile many of the efforts have been popular, his plans to further extend the role and power of the government have been met with criticism from his opponent, Republican Alf Landon. Coming from the oil industry, Landon wants to see greater economic freedom, while Roosevelt and the Democratic Party want to expand Social Security and ensure economic stability. The election may be a close call, or a major victory for the Democrats."
 usa.6.a:0 "The Democrats. Four more years!"

 usa.7.t:0 "Roosevelt vs Willkie"
 usa.7.d:0 "Since the office of President of the United States was first established, no president has ruled for three consecutive terms. However, in light of the precarious state of the world and international developments in the last few years, President Roosevelt has decided to break with tradition and run for a third term. Republican Wendell Willkie, characterized as a dark horse candidate with a background as an industrialist with limited political experience, has been critical both of Roosevelt's economic interventionism and his justifications for running for a third term.\n\nAlthough the candidates have much in common in their foreign policies and Willkie wants to retain some form of the New Deal, many still consider this election a determining point for the future of American democracy."
 usa.7.a:0 "The Democrats. FDR is indispensable."
 usa.7.b:0 "The Republicans. We want Willkie!"
 usa.8.t:0 "Landon vs Roosevelt"
 usa.8.d:0 "President Landon put a stop to the Democrats' continued New Deal reforms four years ago, choosing to rely on the nation's strength lying in industrial companies such as those he helped establish prior to his presidency. Roosevelt, who has continued to campaign in favor of completing the programs he originally planned for his second term, is now running for president again. While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them. The question is who will lead the arsenal of democracy through these dire times."

 usa.9.d:0 "The presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt has already been exceptional in many ways. Despite his declining health and the unprecedented length of his presidency, he aspires to continue leading our country through the war effort. The Republicans have been limited in their choices of candidates due to many potential nominees serving in the war, but have chosen Governor Thomas E. Dewey to represent them.\n\nRoosevelt continues to have popular support, but many suspect he may not live to see the end of his term. But is that sufficient to grant Dewey a victory over the man who has taken us this far?"

Despite declining health, he has managed to retain much of the support which landed him the presidency previously, and is now campaigning for the Democrats again.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] is arguing that a change of leadership in America's sensitive situation would be irresponsible, which is somewhat ironic since the same claim was made before his previous victory over Roosevelt. Despite this, he may have a point."

 usa.11.d:0 "With the continued threat of being drawn into a war, both Democrats and Republicans have aspired to find a candidate from the military. General Douglas MacArthur, normally devoted to his military duties, has taken the opportunity to campaign for the Republican nomination while our nation is at peace and won. He is now challenging Roosevelt, supporting the conservative coalition.\n\nRoosevelt continues to be popular, but MacArthur's charisma and sense of duty has made a strong impression on voters. Does the military really know best?"
 usa.11.a:0 "Roosevelt and Truman will pull through."
 usa.11.b:0 "MacArthur is a man of peace as much as war."
 usa.12.t:0 "Campaign of Douglas MacArthur"
 usa.12.d:0 "To challenge Roosevelt's record-length presidency, the Republicans have looked to respected military commanders, hoping to find a potential candidate to take America through this war. General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"
 usa.12.a:0 "MacArthur is needed more on the front lines than in the White House."
 usa.12.b:0 "We need him to challenge Roosevelt."
 usa.13.t:0 "Roosevelt Passes Away"
 usa.13.d:0 "Although President Roosevelt's health has been in decline for some time, his strong presidential campaign convinced many that he had many years left. However, the possibility of FDR's death while still in office has remained, and today he passed away after suffering a stroke. Vice-President Harry S. Truman has now taken the oath of office, requesting the support and prayers of the people. The old cabinet remains, and Truman has vowed to continue many of the policies of his predecessor."

Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."

 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."

 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, led to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 political.16.b:0 "Let the people be heard."
 political.17.t:0 "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a:0 "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b:0 "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t:0 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"

 political.19.t:0 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 political.19.a:0 "Un-[Root.GetAdjective] activities must be stopped!"

 political.19.c:0 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 political.20.t:0 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 political.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"

 political.22.t:0 "Communists Rise Up"
 political.22.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."

 political.22.b:0 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 political.23.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 political.23.d:0 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."

 political.24.t:0 "Fascists Ridiculed"

A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."

 political.25.t:0 "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 political.25.d:0 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 political.25.a:0 "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 political.26.t:0 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 political.26.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."

It is speculated that the city was chosen as a target because it has been regarded as an intellectual center.\n\nThe beauty and historical significance of the Kyoto led many to assume it would be spared from the bomb, but it appears the terror of raining destruction on such a place has rather been seen as a benefit, increasing the psychological impact of the attack. The city's location in the valley somewhat limited the blast, but the old Imperial Palace and many industrial buildings have been completely destroyed."

The capital of Tokyo, although expected to be the target of firebombing, was never assumed to be a prioritized target of this new weapon. Yet ultimately, perhaps due to the significance of the new capital and Imperial Palace which has now been destroyed, an even more all-consuming fire has fallen on the city.\n\nAlthough [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] is reported to have survived, the event has raised questions about how far Japan's enemies are willing to go.

Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core.

With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack.

France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state.

However, even the vastness of [From.From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy.

Those who try to gain his trust have further fueled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent.

Their stated goal is to overthrow Stalin's tyranny and transition from a totalitarian state, with a board of military officers overseeing the process.\n\nStalin's supporters in the military and the Party have rallied to retain the current regime, calling their opponents counterrevolutionary traitors.

The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."

Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."

Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.

Their names and life stories have been published and very clearly edited to make them appear in the best possible light. Mass peace demonstrations have started in several major cities, demanding an end to the war. The War Office reports that they have received a number of letters of draftees stating openly that they will not appear for duty - saying that they would not, under any circumstances, be party to another execution except as the person to be executed."

That proposal was respected up until today, where news came that Argentina annexed Uruguay. \n\n The Argentines will not expect an attack from us at this moment, so the sooner we cross the border the better. Catching them off guard will be key in making this operation work. \n\n So what should we do, should we step in and intervene, or should we hold back and let them have Uruguay?"

And finally, he began pressuring him and his cabinet to resign. Knowing that Martínez had the gained control of both of the legislative chambers and the support of the Partido Nacional, today, at noon, president Luis Batlle Berres announced his resignation in the Camaras de Senadores y Diputados, soon followed by the resignation of his VP Alfeo Brum and all of his cabinet, taking most of the nation by surprise. \n\nUsing his support on the parliament, Martínez managed to get elected as a interim president by a slim majority."

However, with the industrial revolution in Europe, foreign industries began coming to Uruguay, and with them, came the industrial machinery. This began a process of urbanization and industrialization centered around the capital of Montevideo. Despite all of this, most of the nation's income still comes from agricultural exports, which came into play in the great war, where Uruguay entered a golden age thanks to the income of these exports. \n\nNow, with tensions brewing in both Europe and the rest of the world, economists began debating over whether this system is sustainable on the long run, or if it's time for Uruguay to catch up to modern times. Some members of the government are also worried that a drastic change in our economy could bring discontent amongst the rural population and the elites."

The other authorities, on the other hand, foresee the possibility of a military plot against the civil power, although they are inconclusive conjectures. "

As expected, [COL.GetLeader] had not foreseen this situation, so isolating him and his cabinet in the presidential office was a fairly simple task. The main leaders of conservatism, Gilberto Alzate Avendaño and Laureano Gómez, were soon in attendance. They were received with a standing ovation from supporters who gathered outside the palace to keep abreast of the situation. \n\nAfter several hours, late at night, [COL.GetLeader] finally agreed to sign the resignation and hand over command of the country to the conservative party. The news spread through the streets, and while party supporters celebrated, inside of the palace there was a battle to choose which of the two leaders would take office: the daring falangist Gilberto Alzate or the staunch traditionalist Laureano Gómez."

In contrast, he argued that his mandate could not continue under this scenario, and that he should cede command to someone who did enjoy widespread popular support. Thus, [FROM.GetLeader] formally resigned from the presidential command to hand it over to the current mayor of Bogotá (and candidate for the next elections) Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. \n\nGaitán is an illustrious personality, who not only moves the entire Colombian people with his eloquence and tenacity, but also shows real interest in completely reforming the Colombian system. Among a huge celebration by his followers, Gaitán assumed command of the republic and, after an exquisite discourse, the slogan of his campaign was heard in unison: People, for your victory, charge!"

However, the presidential guard had long enough to notify the army of the situation. The armed forces mobilized and in a matter of minutes the situation was in absolute chaos. Radio stations spread the message quickly and, in anger, hundreds of conservative militants stormed the armories from the police stations and formed large groups of civilians. The onslaught of these divisions was so severe that the opponents, the liberal supporters, also took to the streets with weapons in hand. \n\nThe situation escalated until the two main leaders of the party Conservative, Laureano Gómez and Gilberto Alzate Avendaño, declared that "in the face of the failure of the civilian struggle, only force remains", thus initiating a civil war between conservative supporters and remaining loyalists to the [COL.GetLeader] administration. Even in the army itself, hundreds of soldiers deserted to join the conservative ranks. The republic is now in unprecedented disarray."

Inspired by political ideas of Simón Bolívar, pan-nationalist propaganda has spread throughout the nation, cementing citizens' confidence in the future of their new homeland. \n\nHowever, this “rebirth of the Bolívar's legacy” has given much to talk about in the American continent. While some argue that instability will make the nascent republic collapse, others consider that external threats are a bigger problem. For now, the future of the Colombian people remains a mystery."
 colombia.91.a:0 "The world will know what we are capable of!"
 colombia.91.b:0 "Another power imbalance in the region."
 colombia.91.c:0 "It won't last long!"


 colombia.92.title:0 "Coup d'etat in Gran Colombia"
 colombia.92.desc:0 "In response to the collapse of the civil administration in Colombia during the presidency of Laureano Gómez, the two traditional parties of the country supported a rebellion led by general Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Although this rebellion was close to becoming another civil war for the country, the military finally deposed the government of Laureano Gómez and installed Rojas Pinilla as the new head of state. \n\nThis historic event has been named the 'opinion coup' by analysts, since it has been supported by almost every non-Laureanist political sector of the nation. Even though the new government has not given express statements, Rojas Pinilla is expected to stabilize the country and reduce the violent legacy of his predecessor."
 colombia.92.a:0 "A new era for Colombia!"
 colombia.92.b:0 "It was to be expected."
 colombia.92.c:0 "We will defeat them in any case!"


 colombia.93.title:0 "Óscar Benavides rebels against the government!"
 colombia.93.desc:0 "General Óscar Benavides had been showing tendencies towards insubordination for some time. It was clear that he did not fully agree with the new government that was established after the Constituent Assembly. Today it was finally announced that his rebellion is definitive: Benavides left his position and crossed into Colombia at the time of the declaration of war. Now he is at the service of our enemies, trying to establish a new regime in our nation with their support."
 colombia.93.a:0 "Traitor!"


 colombia.95.title:0 "The provisional government of Loreto "
 colombia.95.desc:0 "With Loreto under occupation by our armed forces, general Óscar Benavides has suggested establishing the new Peruvian provisional government there. An administrative order has already been established to maintain order, and they have begun to recruit military militias to support the Peruvian cause. Benavides has expressed his gratitude to us, and hopes that the relations between the new Peruvian state and our nation will be close and friendly."
 colombia.95.a:0 "Together we will reestablish order in Peru."


 colombia.96.title:0 "The death of Vásquez Cobo"
 colombia.96.desc:0 "The republic is in mourning. After suffering several health problems, general Vásquez Cobo, hero of the Colombian-Peruvian war and great opponent of the politicians, died today. His advanced age was not an impediment to lead the coup against the two traditional parties, which were leading the nation to a state of cyclical and perpetual violence. His legacy will live on in the future of the nation and his dedication will never be forgotten by the Colombian people. But now the question is: who will lead the republic? "
 colombia.96.a:0 "Establishing a Military Junta will keep personal interests out."
 colombia.96.b:0 "The General Staff will assume governmental functions."
 colombia.96.c:0 "General Villamizar must take command."
 colombia.96.d:0 "General Bonitto Vega is the right leader."


 colombia.97.title1:0 "The army takes control of Japurá"
 colombia.97.title2:0 "The armed forces occupy Mapari"
 colombia.97.desc1:0 "The coordinated attack that we have planned on Japurá has been a complete success. The Brazilian forces have withdrawn and have been disorganized while ours have triumphantly occupied the state. There is no need to wait to find out that [BRA.GetLeader] will not react in the best way to this event, but at least the supremacy of our army over theirs has been assured. Japurá will soon be officially reintegrated to Colombia."
 colombia.97.desc2:0 "The rapid offensive of our troops was a brutal clash between our army and the Brazilian. The resulting combat lasted for a time until ending with our victory and subsequent occupation of Mapari. The commanders of the battalions have received multiple praise for this victory as well as the general in charge of leading the confrontation. Mapari is definitely under Colombian control, as it should be."


 colombia.98.title1:0 "The army is defeated in Japurá"
 colombia.98.title2:0 "Our forces are defeated in Mapari"
 colombia.98.desc1:0 "The coordinated attack we have planned on Japurá has been a total failure. The Brazilian forces put up fierce resistance and it was impossible for our soldiers to secure the territory. No need to wait to find out that [BRA .GetLeader] will not react in the best way to this event no matter how successful they are. In the worst-case scenario, a full-scale war could break out between our nations."
 colombia.98.desc2:0 "The rapid offensive of our troops was a brutal clash between our army and the Brazilian. The resulting combat lasted for a time, but unfortunately we were unable to take control of Mapari. The commanders of the battalions can't explain how such a planned attack did not have the expected success, while the general in command alludes to various factors of different kinds. The troops have been very demoralized by this defeat, just as public opinion questions the true effectiveness of our army."


 colombia.99.title1:0 "The attack on Japurá is repelled"
 colombia.99.title2:0 "Colombians withdraw from Mapari"
 colombia.99.desc1:0 "Colombia has had the audacity to launch a major offensive against our forces in Japurá from nearby bases. It was something we expected knowing the dictatorial ambitions of [COL.GetLeader]. Fortunately, our brave soldiers succeeded in stopping their operation and repelled the invaders. This heroic defense has shown that our army continues to be of a higher standard, reinforcing our sovereignty in the region and our national unity."
 colombia.99.desc2:0 "An unexpected Colombian attack on the garrisons in Mapari forced our men to engage the aggressors. Fortunately, the divisions were strong enough to hold their positions and not even a meter of land ended up under enemy control. [BRA.GetLeader] has praised the work and heroism of the soldiers in the Amazon, but still questions whether it would be appropriate to organize a military response or maintain the status quo."
 colombia.99.a:0 "We demonstrate our supremacy."
 colombia.99.b:0 "It's an act of aggression!"


 colombia.100.title1:0 "Colombian forces occupy Japurá"

 colombia.100.desc1:0 "Colombia has had the audacity to launch a major offensive against our forces in Japurá from nearby bases. It was something we expected knowing the dictatorial ambitions of [COL.GetLeader]. Unfortunately, our army was unable to repel the attack and the state has fallen into the hands of the Colombians. It seems that our nation is in decline, and it is possible that other nations take advantage of this appearance to gain their own advantage."
 colombia.100.desc2:0 "An unexpected Colombian attack on the garrisons in Mapari forced our men to engage in combat with the aggressors. Unfortunately, it was impossible to repel the attack and the state has ended up under Colombian occupation. The military officials suggest finalizing a plan to drive them back, but considering the outcome of the battle, it is likely to be fruitless."
 colombia.100.a:0 "Let them have it then."
 colombia.100.b:0 "That's unheard of!"


 colombia.101.title:0 "Colombia plans to seize our territory in the north "
 colombia.101.desc:0 "[COL.GetLeader] has had the nerve to claim for his nation the territory that we control in the north and that we just obtained several years ago. If we do not send a defense contingent to the border with Colombia they may seize it without a word, which would be a disservice to our government and to the Brazilian army. "
 colombia.101.a:0 "We will handle the situation properly."


 colombia.102.title:0 "Exiled Colombian politicians offer their support"
 colombia.102.desc:0 "After the coup d'etat led by Alfredo Vásquez Cobo in Colombia, many politicians had to go into exile due to the imminent takeover of power by the military. However, they remained determined to retake power in their nation and re-establish the previous institutional order. This is their opportunity. Several of those exiles have offered the government to collaborate with us in our struggle, giving us their knowledge about the internal workings of the country to obtain a strategic advantage. Our government advisers don't agree about accepting or not this offer, as we are uncertain about his intentions or if they are even true."
 colombia.102.a:0 "We needed that help!"
 colombia.102.b:0 "We can't trust them"


 colombia.103.title:0 "Politicians in exile are supporting [From.GetName]!"
 colombia.103.desc:0 "After Alfredo Vásquez Cobo's coup in Colombia, many politicians had to go into exile due to the imminent takeover of power by the military. However, they remained determined to regain control and re-establish the previous institutional order. Now, with the conflict looming over Colombia, these exiles have found their opportunity to act; they have had the audacity to offer themselves to the [From.GetAdjective] government as collaborators to overthrow the new military regime. Now the enemy knows how our government works and it will have a strategic advantage in combat."
 colombia.103.a:0 "Even from abroad they betray their country!"

 colombia.104.desc:0 "Our support for the unionist forces has been of great help in their campaign. The triumph of their mission has been well received by the population, and the new Peru-Bolivian Confederation has been officially proclaimed. [PRU.GetLeader] has notified its gratitude to our government, and hopes that the relations between the new nation and ours will be close and rewarding. However, they may be suspicious of our intentions to maintain the hegemony of the region, which could lead to future conflict. But those guesses are inconclusive, and as long as our actions are subtle, there should be no downsides to our work."
 colombia.104.a:0 "Excellent."


 colombia.105.title:0 "Unionists Prepare for Insurrection!"
 colombia.105.desc:0 "The moment we least expected has finally arrived. We know that the unionist militias are preparing to take up arms, and there is not much we can do but prepare for the impending civil war. It is very likely that they will count with the military support of the Colombians, but the situation does not allow us to deal with them now. We must face the unionists first and then we will take charge of their architects."
 colombia.105.a:0 "We will crush them!"


 colombia.106.title:0 "The Colombian government supports the subversive militias"
 colombia.106.desc:0 "Our intelligence reports report that far-right organizations that advocate for the reunification of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation are increasing their activities in the nation. These incidents were previously isolated, but are intensifying due to what appears to be financial support from Colombians. These accusations are delicate, so the absence of conclusive evidence leaves us in an unworkable position. In any case, it is best to prepare before it is too late."

Multiple reports of bombings have already occurred, and fighting is happening as this message is being sent globally. \n\nThe country is very evenly split, and many experts are unsure as to what the outcome of this conflict will be, nor the consequences it will bring. \n\nAll what we can do is hope the situation doesn't escalate beyond Bolivia's borders."

 ### Brazil ###
 brazil.1.t:0 "Coffee Plantations Offer to Help our Economy"
 brazil.1.d:0 "Owners of various coffee plantations have come to an agreement and decided to lend us some of their assets to our government in order to help us in our projects. \n\nTheir help will come in very handy and may give us just the amount we need for many of our most ambitious projects. It doesn't seem like they want to be repaid, as long as we allow their plantations to thrive under our management."
 brazil.1.a:0 "This will be of great help!"


 brazil.2.t:0 "Urban Development has Destroyed one of our Plantations"
 brazil.2.d:0 "News has come to us that urban development has expanded so much that it has destroyed a plantation. The owners of said plantation are very mad at our 'negligence' of the situation and demand we re-establish their plantation and/or cut back on our urban development. \n\nAt this stage we need to industrialize our nation so stepping back at this point will not cut it. Our dependency on coffee will decrease, but maybe it's for the better."
 brazil.2.a:0 "Sorry about that..."


 brazil.3.t:0 "Illegal Coffee Plantation has Been Set Up"
 brazil.3.d:0 "Due to the diminishing power of the coffee plantations on the nation's economy, many have started setting up illegal plantations in different parts of the country. The owners of these illegal plantations seem to be annoyed at our management of the plantations, and they claim we have been treating them rather poorly, so that's why they decided to protest by setting up these illegal plantations. \n\nShould we stop the people behind these illegal plantations? Or do we let this slide and see what it leads to?"
 brazil.3.a:0 "Let them do it"
 brazil.3.b:0 "Prevent them from doing it"


 brazil.4.t:0 "Plantations Rebel against the Government"
 brazil.4.d:0 "Some of the plantations, either legally or illegally set up, have begun rebelling against our government ever since our sudden shift to an industrialized economy. \n\nIt seems as if our transition to an industrialized economy will not be as smooth as it seemed. We will need to fight fire with fire and shut down the rebels before it's too late. \n\nThere's no telling how this will go, but we just have to hope for the best."
 brazil.4.a:0 "We will win this battle!"


 brazil.5.t:0 "The Plantations have been Successfully Stopped"
 brazil.5.d:0 "After many months of back and forths, we were able to successfully stop the rebelling plantations and calm down the situation. Due to the mass protests and bloody repression of them, we will most likely never be able to depend on coffee, at least for a long time. \n\nThe good thing is we can now fully focus on building up our economy and growing our industry. If all goes well, we will be able to put this awful incident behind and look towards a bright new future."
 brazil.5.a:0 "This was for the better"


 brazil.6.t:0 "Farmers Agreed to our Agreement"
 brazil.6.d:0 "The owners of the plantations in our nation have agreed to allow our nation to industrialize at a slow and controlled speed, allowing their plantations to continue thriving while we slowly industrialize."

 brazil.7.t:0 "Farmers Refused our Agreement"

 brazil.8.t:0 "How Much Would You Like to Invest in the Military?"
 brazil.8.d:0 "We have the choice to invest a certain quantity of our political power over the nation on our army expansion.

 brazil.9.d:0 "Brazilian politicians and generals have arrived in Washington D.C. today to ask us for a request. They are requesting access to produce our tanks, and for some of our tanks. \n\nOur relations with Brazil and the Brazilians have been improving in recent years, and their dominant status in South America could be of great strategic importance to us, especially in the future if we ever find ourselves in a dire situation. \n\nWith these factors in mind, should we accept their request?"
 brazil.9.a:0 "Accept their request"
 brazil.9.b:0 "Deny their request"


 brazil.10.t:0 "Brazil is Requesting to Purchase one of our Carriers"

 brazil.11.t:0 "Political Opponents Protest Against our Propaganda Campaigns"
 brazil.11.d:0 "Various officials and many of their supporters have retaliated against our increase in influence over the political sphere of the nation.

We should be aware of what Vargas is planning and we need to make sure he does not get in our way."
 brazil.15.a:0 "We'll make sure he doesn't!"


 brazil.16.t:0 "Congress has Intervened in our Plans"
 brazil.16.d:0 "The Congress of Brazil has noticed our unprecedented actions on the state and has imposed various reforms to try and reduce the influence over our nation. \n\nConsidering the power of the congress at this moment, not much can be done, but with enough effort and time, we might be able to turn the tides."
 brazil.16.a:0 "They won't be able to stop us"


 brazil.17.t:0 "Congress Intervenes in our Plans for a Dictatorship"
 brazil.17.d:0 "The congress has noticed some of our odd actions and have begun establishing nationwide reforms to push back the progress of our dictatorship. \n\nHow they were able to figure out our plans is still a mystery, but we need to be wary of their actions.

 brazil.19.d:0 "The communists have begun spreading mass propaganda about their movement to the people of Brazil, especially within the states where subversive activity is currently active. \n\nThey are also targeting a lot the farmers and the lower class, so we need to watch out in the states where we have plantations."

 brazil.20.t:0 "The Communists are Planning on Wreaking Havoc in a State!"
 brazil.20.d:0 "Some of our undercover spies have reported back a rather daunting discovery: the communists are planning on deliberately causing damage in a state where they have influence over to make their voice heard. \n\nWe need to be very careful as we do not know yet how severe the damage may be. We should try and stop them as quickly as possible."
 brazil.20.a:0 "Are you serious?"


 brazil.22.t:0 "The Integralists Increase their Influence over the Country"
 brazil.22.d:0 "Using some rather questionable tactics, the Integralists have increased their influence over the politics of this country and are beginning to pose a serious threat to the administrative power that we have over the country. \n\nWe need to try and stop them before they get too powerful. At the very least we should make sure to keep them friendly to our government."

 brazil.23.t:0 "Congress Drafts Reforms to Control the Nation more Effectively"
 brazil.23.d:0 "The Congress has officially announced a new wave of reforms for the country and its politics in order to set an even larger foothold on the nation.

 brazil.23.a:0 "Pesky Annoyance"


 brazil.24.t:0 "Our Spies Successfully Countered the Communists"
 brazil.24.d:0 "Our spies have reported back with some fantastic news, they were able to crack down on the case and arrest the communists who were occupying the state. \n\nWith such an important victory, the communist movement is sure to take a huge hit from this.

 brazil.24.a:0 "This is fantastic news!"


 brazil.25.t:0 "Our Spies were Countered"
 brazil.25.d:0 "Our spies were unfortunately defeated by the communists while trying to stop the communist subversive activity. \n\nThis was a huge defeat, and an utter humiliation. The communists will most likely take full advantage of this defeat to use it against us. \n\nAll what's left is to hope we can stop whatever's going to come next."
 brazil.25.a:0 "This is terrible!"


 brazil.26.t:0 "The Integralists are Expecting Plinio Salgado to be Appointed"
 brazil.26.d:0 "The Integralists so far have been supporting our efforts to establish a more authoritative rule, and due to this they are expecting that we appoint Plínio Salgado as a minister of education. \n\nWhether or not we do that is ultimately up to us, and each of our choices will have both positives and negatives."
 brazil.26.a:0 "For now we'll see"

 brazil.29.t:0 "Integralist Supporters Begin Countrywide Protests"
 brazil.29.d:0 "The Integralists have taken the streets all across the nation to protest against the suppression of their movement, and the administration of our country. Plínio Salgado and Gustavo Barroso are the spearheaders of these protests, and are purposefully trying to destabilize the nation. \n\nThese protests must stop immediately, and the leaders arrested. If these protests continue, then we may be in serious trouble."
 brazil.29.a:0 "Down with Integralism!"


 brazil.30.t:0 "The Integralists Intensify their Uprising"
 brazil.30.d:0 "Using various cheap propaganda tactics and influence over the nation, the Integralists have intensified their uprising and are making full-scaled plans in the up-and-coming civil war. \n\nWe need to be well prepared for this conflict, all our men must be conscripted in the event of a full-on civil war."
 brazil.30.a:0 "Let's hope we can stop this"


 brazil.31.t:0 "Carlos Prestes has been Arrested"
 brazil.31.d:0 "The communist revolutionary Carlos Prestes has been caught and arrested by our authorities. This will deal a huge blow to the communist movement and will surely affect them for years to come. \n\nThis won't be a completely smooth victory, as the communists will most likely do one last ditch effort to retaliate against Prestes's imprisonment, but without their leader we should be able to deal with it rather quickly."
 brazil.31.a:0 "Great!"


 brazil.33.t:0 "Prestes Begins Plans for a Revolt"
 brazil.33.d:0 "After working beneath the shadows for some time now, the Communists have begun planning a full-scale uprising to avenge the failed uprising attempt of 1935. \n\nUnlike last time, this time it seems to be much more organized, and the amount of people backing Prestes is much greater than the 1935 attempt. We need to be careful here, one wrong move could cost us greatly."
 brazil.33.a:0 "They'll be crushed!"


 brazil.35.t:0 "Hostile Coffee Farmers Speak Up Against our Party"
 brazil.35.d:0 "Angry coffee farmers have taken up the countryside to protest and speak up against our party. They demand we give them more political representation, and invest more of our resources into the coffee plantations."
 brazil.35.a:0 "We don't need this now"


 brazil.36.t:0 "Hostile Coffee Plantations Have Boycotted Their Profits"
 brazil.36.d:0 "The hostile coffee plantations have united and boycotted our economy by preventing their profits from reaching the national government. This act of protesting is proving to be detrimental to our economy and we should deal with them as fast as we can."
 brazil.36.a:0 "They will be put in their place!"


 brazil.37.t:0 "Vargas has Suppressed our Movement"
 brazil.37.d:0 "Vargas has noticed our movement gaining traction amongst the people, so he and his cabinet members have decided to take a more political approach. Vargas has publicly defamed our movement and made moves to suppress our ability to spread our movement to other places of the country. \n\nThis tyrannical rule will soon crumble and Vargas will pay for what he did!"
 brazil.37.a:0 "Well said fellow supporter. Vargas shall fall!"


 brazil.38.t:0 "Vargas Destabilizes our Plans"
 brazil.38.d:0 "With scummy tactics, Vargas has interfered with our plans and destabilized our revolt to an extent. Due to this, we need to accelerate our plans in order to compensate for this hiccup."

 brazil.41.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] has Refused to Help us"
 brazil.41.d:0 "Our undercover agents have come back from [FROM.GetName] with heartbreaking news. They said they will not lend us help in our revolt against the government."
 brazil.41.a:0 "This is Terrible!"


 brazil.42.t:0 "Vargas has Found out About our Activity and Interfered!"
 brazil.42.d:0 "Vargas has found out about our activity by means of which we have yet to find out. Our men have been arrested carrying out this task and our overall plans have been setback due to this. \n\nWe need to be more careful in the near future, or else Vargas may find out about all our plans."
