 COL_la_revolucion_en_marcha_desc:0 "López Pumarejo's flagship program, the so-called Revolución en Marcha, is popular even among conservatives. It aims at the modernization of the country, industrialization, updating of social laws and structural reforms of society. In short, it enshrines that the duty of the state is to "effect by peaceful means everything that would make a revolution.""
 COL_integrar_la_inversion_militar:0 "Military Investment Integration"

 COL_continuar_la_reforma_agraria_desc:0 "It is evident that in Colombia the distribution of land is unequal; while the large landowners appropriate entire hectares, the peasants are left on the sidelines and unable to compete economically. We must insist on ratifying an agrarian reform, which justifies the partition of the land and state intervention, even if it's something burdensome."

 COL_mantener_los_privilegios_patronales_desc:0 "It is a fact that Colombian landowners are the ones who best know how to manage agricultural production. We can't just put anyone in charge or the entire economy would collapse. Although it hurts to the trade unions, preserving the legal privileges of the employers is the only way to develop the country."
 COL_surcando_mar_y_oceano:0 "Sailing through Sea and Ocean"

 COL_astilleros_del_pacifico:0 "The Pacific Dockyards"
 COL_astilleros_del_pacifico_desc:0 "Part of developing the nation economically is embracing the ability to manufacture our own ships. The Pacific coast, being an important point of commerce and direct exit to the east, is the perfect place to position this industry. "
 COL_armada_de_la_republica:0 "The Navy of the Republic"
 COL_armada_de_la_republica_desc:0 "It is unheard of that we have only three obsolete destroyers while other American nations even have battleships. It is obvious that we cannot match their naval strength immediately, but the first step is to properly structure the navy following the example of the great powers."
 COL_la_mision_de_rojas_pinilla:0 "The Mission of Rojas Pinilla"
 COL_la_mision_de_rojas_pinilla_desc:0 "During the Colombian-Peruvian war of 1932, Lieutenant Gustavo Rojas Pinilla argued that Colombian military industry and study techniques are outdated. For this reason, the high command has prepared a special mission to update these aspects, and it only requires the presidential sanction to carry it out."

 COL_fuerza_aerea_colombiana_desc:0 "It is still remembered that the first president in the world to use an official aircraft was the Colombian Pedro Nel Ospina in 1922.

 COL_ejercito_nacional:0 "The National Army"
 COL_ejercito_nacional_desc:0 "Our glorious army has its roots in independence, and since then brave soldiers have given themselves body and soul to the defense of our sovereignty.

 COL_produccion_aeronautica:0 "Aeronautical Production"

 COL_modernizar_el_armamento:0 "Modernize the Weapons"
 COL_modernizar_el_armamento_desc:0 "We cannot continue to supply our troops with weapons from a decade ago and expect their performance to be outstanding. It is necessary to redirect part of the military spending in the development of updated and efficient equipment capable of dealing with foreign machinery."
 COL_indumil:0 "INDUMIL"
 COL_indumil_desc:0 "It is clear that the monopoly of arms production cannot be handed over to any private individual, but neither can the State sustain dispersed and disorganized production. The appropriate thing will be to centralize production in a public company, the Colombian Military Industry (INDUMIL)."
 COL_tacticas_aereas:0 "Air Tactics"
 COL_tacticas_aereas_desc:0 "Air combat is complex, much more than land or sea combat. It involves a large amount of disciplines and knowledge that needs to be studied in detail. Otherwise, we will be doomed to lose the war in the air."
 COL_fabricas_nacionales:0 "National Factories"
 COL_fabricas_nacionales_desc:0 "Our production is becoming more and more dependent on foreign industry. This vicious cycle must be curbed by financing factories with national headquarters that create jobs and maintain good performance in times of crisis."
 COL_estrategia_de_altamar:0 "The High Seas Strategy"
 COL_estrategia_de_altamar_desc:0 "Fighting in the open sea is not the same as crossing a river or a lagoon. The navy must be prepared to do battle in places far from the coast, even if it means restructuring the entire naval training program."
 COL_vigilancia_costera:0 "Coastal Patrolling"
 COL_vigilancia_costera_desc:0 "We must accept that we are incapable of protecting the nation's vast maritime boundaries. The only viable option to defend ourselves is to establish a patrolling system along the Pacific coast and the Caribbean, thus keeping naval intelligence updated in real time."
 COL_fuego_del_cielo:0 "Fire from the skies"
 COL_fuego_del_cielo_desc:0 "If we cannot charge militarily on the ground, then we will rampage from the air. We will develop bomber models able to attack key enemy points, and we will make them tremble by deploying a rain of fire of biblical proportions over them. "

 COL_motorizar_la_infanteria:0 "Motorize the Infantry"
 COL_motorizar_la_infanteria_desc:0 "In the long term, a cavalry battalion is much more logistically costly than a motorized one. We cannot afford to take multi-day horseback riding to the front while our divisions urgently need reinforcements. We will implement a massive motorization plan to make a competent army."
 COL_fortalecer_la_marina_mercante:0 "Strengthen the Merchant Marine"
 COL_fortalecer_la_marina_mercante_desc:0 "The merchant marine may not be very useful in peacetime, but in a war they will be an essential support for logistics and transportation.

 COL_proteccion_desde_las_profundidades:0 "Protection from the Depths"
 COL_proteccion_desde_las_profundidades_desc:0 "The future of naval combat is not in the waves, but under them. Using a fleet of submarines will give us a huge advantage against a surface attacker, and we will even be able to weaken their trade and transport."
 COL_policia_militar:0 "Military police"
 COL_policia_militar_desc:0 "A regular police made up of civilians, is not the most suitable for a nation with a war legacy like ours. We will militarize the institution so that it serves as a support not only in the internal order, but also on the battlefield if it becomes necessary."
 COL_defensa_desde_tierra:0 "Defense From Ground"
 COL_defensa_desde_tierra_desc:0 "We are too delusional if we believe that the navy is sufficient defense against a naval invasion. We need to establish a line of protection capable of protecting ourselves, so we will order the construction of hundreds of forts that will be impregnable against any amphibious assault."

 COL_manufactura_blindada:0 "Armor Manufacturing"
 COL_manufactura_blindada_desc:0 "Let's face it, a cavalry charge has no chance against an armored offensive, nor a transport truck against a war tank. The time has come for our military industry to be flexible by adding armor production to our infantry."
 COL_topografia_militar:0 "Military Topography"
 COL_topografia_militar_desc:0 "Studying the terrain is also essential when planning an offense or a defensive line. Taking advantage of the vast and varied geography of our nation we will train our theorists to carry out specific logistical tasks if becomes necessary in the field of combat."
 COL_propiedad_social:0 "Common Property"
 COL_propiedad_social_desc:0 "We cannot continue to see property as a private form of economic exploitation. The State must recognize the social function that property has as an aid to the less favored, including those who own a lot and exploit little. We will not allow this margin of inequality to continue among the Colombian population."
 COL_legalizar_las_huelgas:0 "Legalize Strikes"
 COL_legalizar_las_huelgas_desc:0 "Something that is as common as strikes is still considered illegal in the country. It is nothing more than a vindication of workers' rights, and it is a despotic tactic to consider it a crime. The legislation must change immediately."
 COL_organizar_los_sindicatos:0 "Organize the Labor Unions"
 COL_organizar_los_sindicatos_desc:0 "The unions today are nothing more than disorganized labor circles without a clear list of demands and with internal disagreements. If the government steps in and helps organize them, we will get a large working class community that will maximize production by agreeing on their points of view."
 COL_priorizar_al_obrero:0 "Prioritize the Worker"
 COL_priorizar_al_obrero_desc:0 "There is a lot of talk about entrepreneurship and large industrialists, but the average wage earner is left aside.

 COL_garantizar_el_acceso_universitario:0 "Guarantee University Access"
 COL_garantizar_el_acceso_universitario_desc:0 "It is not fair that only a handful of individuals are the ones who have access to higher education while the rest of the people are condemned to informal or poorly paid work. Public universities are the key to closing the Colombian educational gap."
 COL_cooperar_con_los_terratenientes:0 "Cooperate with Landowners"
 COL_cooperar_con_los_terratenientes_desc:0 "The large landowners are the ones who know what is best for the national economy. The State itself is incapable of managing everything as a material unit, but if it works as a private entity, it may be a sustainable model. We will establish agreements with the landowners so that the State works in accordance with them."
 COL_semilleros_de_investigacion:0 "Hotbeds of Research"
 COL_semilleros_de_investigacion_desc:0 "Commissioning state laboratories to develop all kinds of technology will only collapse the research program. The appropriate thing is to distribute the scientific loads in different Hotbeds to make the work more dynamic."
 COL_ferrocarriles_nacionales_de_colombia:0 "Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia"
 COL_ferrocarriles_nacionales_de_colombia_desc:0 "The train is still a totally viable means of transport, but it has not received the attention it deserves. The national railways are abandoned and underinvested, in addition to the fact that the railway lines are almost non-existent. It is imperative to strengthen this sector before the country becomes a bunch  of isolated regions."
 COL_concesiones_estatales:0 "State Concessions"
 COL_concesiones_estatales_desc:0 "Handing over part of public needs to the private sector may sound bad at first for labor unions, but it is a feasible strategy to reduce state inefficiency and increase economic growth."
 COL_educacion_privada:0 "Private education"
 COL_educacion_privada_desc:0 "Overloading the public education system will not bring long-term benefits. Education is a service that can also be privatized and will be better provided by this sector."
 COL_expansion_industrial:0 "Industrial Expansion"
 COL_expansion_industrial_desc:0 "We must think ahead, in a Colombia with great internal industrial capacity, so we cannot concentrate all the industry in large urban areas. Expanding productive capacity to the periphery will allow decentralizing production and improving economic growth rates."

 COL_una_colombia_moderna_desc:0 "This new Colombia was reborn renewed and self-sufficient. We will be a nation that does not depend on imports to survive, nor be left behind in technological development.

 COL_la_reforma_constitucional:0 "The Constitutional Reform"
 COL_la_reforma_constitucional_desc:0 "The time has come to make a significant change in Colombia. The State can no longer be understood as a “police” but rather as an entity at the service of the people and that guarantees rights and the fulfillment of duties. Thus, we must separate the state from the church, at least partially, to avoid its polarization."
